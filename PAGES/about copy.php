<h2>About</h2>
<div style="float: left; width: 400px;">

<p><strong><i>Low Tide</i></strong> is a <span class="blueuppercase">two-fold project</span> assembling a comprehensive survey of visual Bay histories.</p>

<p class="blueuppercase"><strong>COLLECTING/ARCHIVING</strong></p>

<p>Working mainly from our office donated by Bug Press in Arcata, CA, we are collecting material on Humboldt Bay to reproduce as a book, exhibition and digital archive, incorporating photos, charts, maps and other graphics dating from as early as we can find up to today.</p>

<p>Our aim is to include the entirety of every document published, within evolving limits. We expect collecting and sorting material will go on through 2013.</p>

<p>People and institutions, from Bay Keepers to the Yacht Club and the Humboldt County Historical Society, are helping us gather and sort materials (see Support).</p>

<p>Many documents have been, and more will be, lost without this effort. For instance, an extensive documentation on the dolosse reinforcement of Bay jetties we received from the Eureka office of California Sea Grant in June 2012. Taking these scattered documents from offices and special collections to make them viewable together not only assures that some will survive for future enjoyment and study, but it opens up entirely new </p>

<p> ways to interpret and understand the Bay.

<p>Once complete, this visual Bay archive and database is intended for public use.</p>

<p class="blueuppercase"><strong>BOOK AND EXHIBITION</strong></p>

<p>From the archive, we will design and produce a large-scale, all-encompassing book and a normally-sized exhibition.</p>

<p>Through a mostly visual presentation―encyclopedic in scope, wide-ranging and immersive―the book will portray Humboldt Bay waters through the materials gathered, supplementing where obvious gaps appear. </p>

<p>To our knowledge, no such treatment of any Bay currently exists. And in the case of Humboldt Bay, there is not even the simplest picture book available for serious reference or as a souvenir for visitors.</p>

<p>By replicating digital-like information density in book form, we strive to produce the most robust type of archive and reading platform now possible. One that can't be erased by a thunderstorm, one that may be encountered directly in space and that may be referenced over decades without ever making a software or hardware update.</p>
